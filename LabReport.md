##Command "cd"

When I executed "cd lecture1" I was in the home directory, and when I added the directory name after cd I moved to the Lecture1 directory. This command executes smoothly and I can jump directly to any directory I own.

When I entered and executed the "cd" command, I was in the [user@sahara ~/lecture1]$ directory. After executing the command, I returned to the home directory from the Lecture1 directory. The meaning of the cd command is Change Directory. We can switch between different paths by adding the path after cd.

When I try to change the directory, the error is displayed because Hello.java is a file name, not a directory, and the cd command changes the working directory, not the file. If you want to view or edit the content, you should use the cat command.

##Command "ls"
