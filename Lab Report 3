CSE15L Lab Report 3 - Bugs and Commands (Week 5)

# Part1:Bugs
Part 1 - Bugs
Choose one of the bugs from week 4’s lab.

I chose the error of "averageWithoutLowest" in ArrayExamples.

Provide:
·A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
Code inside ArrayTests.java：
 @Test
  public void averageWithoutLowest() {
    double [] input1 = {-1.0, -2.0, -3.0, -3.0};
    double expected = -1.5;
    assertEquals(expected, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1), 0.01);
  }


·An input that doesn’t induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code (write it as a code block in Markdown)
Code inside ArrayTests.java：
@Test
  public void averageWithoutLowest2() {
    double [] input1 = {1.0, 2.0, 4.0};
    double expected = 3.0;
    assertEquals(expected, ArrayExamples.averageWithoutLowest(input1), 0.01);
  }

·The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)
