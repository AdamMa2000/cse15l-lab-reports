# Lab Report4 Vim(Week7)

For the lab report this week, reproduce the task from above on your own. For each numbered step starting right after the timer (so steps 4-9), take a screenshot, and write down exactly which keys you pressed to get to that step. For special characters like <enter> or <tab>, write them in angle brackets with code formatting. Then, summarize the commands you ran and what the effect of those keypresses were.

## Step4: Log into ieng6

First I type **ssh cs15lfa23ns@ieng6.ucsd.edu**, then press <Enter>, at the end enter my password. I successfully logged into ieng6.

## Step5：Clone your fork of the repository from your Github account

I used the following keys: **git clone git@github.com:UCSDNobel1998/lab7.git<enter>** ; Clone by using SSH Url.

## Step 6: Run the tests, demonstrating that they fail
